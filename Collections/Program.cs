using Collections;

//ARRAYS
//Arrays arrayobj =  new Arrays();

//arrayobj.ExecuteArrays();
//arrayobj.LoopArrays();

//DISADVANTAGES OF ARRAYS
//1. Fixed size
//2. Cannot add/remove items
//3. Not flexible
//4. Not convenient to sort - use Array.Sort() 

//ADVANTAGS OF ARRAYS 
//1. Fast
//2. Efficient memory usage


//ARRAYLIST - ArrayList in C# is a non-generic collection class that works like an array but provides the facilities such
//as dynamic resizing, adding, and deleting elements from the middle of a collection.

//ArrayList arraylistobj = new ArrayList();
//arraylistobj.ExecuteArrayList();

//DISADVANTAGES OF ARRAYLIST
//1. Not type safe
//2. Slower than generic collections
//3. Every time you retrieve an item from the list, it has to be unboxed    

//ADVANTAGES OF ARRAYLIST
//1. Dynamic size
//2. Flexible
//3. Convenient methods to add/remove items
//4. Convenient methods to sort items

//GENERICS - Generic in C# is a type parameter that is used to create generic classes, interfaces, and methods.

//LISTS - Generic List in C# is a generic class that works on the List<T> class. It is the same as ArrayList

//Lists listobj = new Lists();
//listobj.ExecuteList();

//LISTS WITH EMPLOYEES EXAMPLE

List_Employee listempobj = new List_Employee();
listempobj.ExecuteListEmployees();
